# Creating Compendium Packs for Species Generator

The Species Generator can be enhanced with pre-built compendium packs containing:

## 1. Example Species Pack
- 20-30 pre-generated species for immediate use
- Organized by archetype and cultural framework
- Includes full SWADE stats and narrative hooks

## 2. Extended Tables Pack
- Additional biological archetypes (crystalline, gaseous, etc.)
- More cultural frameworks (hive-mind collective, digital consciousness)
- Extended naming patterns for different galactic regions
- Specialized hooks for different campaign themes

## 3. SWADE Traits Compendium
- Custom edges and hindrances for alien species
- Racial abilities with mechanical effects
- Equipment suited for different species types

## 4. Quick Reference Pack
- GM reference sheets for rapid species creation
- NPC stat blocks for common species roles
- Quick encounter tables featuring generated species

To create these packs:
1. Use Foundry's built-in compendium tools
2. Export generated species directly to compendiums
3. Organize by theme or campaign setting
4. Include proper tags and search metadata

This allows GMs to have both procedural generation AND curated content for their campaigns.
